    "# QCArchive Workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows you how to get started with QCArchive - a MolSSI software product that helps you run quantum chemistry calculations and archive the results.  In most cases, QCArchive would be set up on a server for your reserach group or team, and access to the calculations and the results would be limited to whoever was granted access to your server.  In this tutorial, we will be using the MolSSI QCArchive demonstration server, so that you can get a feel for what QCArchive can do.  \n",
    "\n",
    "QCArchive actually has multiple parts, including the QCPortal, which is how you interact with the server.  We will be using QCPortal and some of its features in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing QCPortal\n",
    "You have to intall QCPortal on your computer to use it to interact with the QCArchive Server.   We maintain a QCPortal environment file that you can install with the acadonda API, that will create an enviroment and install all the required components for QCArchive.  To use this, you need to have the anaconda-client installed in your base conda environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First install anaconda-client in your base environment, using this command.  (If it is already installed, it will just tell you it is already installed.) <br>\n",
    "`conda install anaconda-client -n base`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then create the qcarchive_demo enviorment and install all required software with this command <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "Now activate your conda enviroment, and then restart this notebook. <br>\n",
